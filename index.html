	    <h1> <b>Introduction</b> </h1>
	    <p> Welcome to my personal archive where my classmates, instructors, and employers
	    can learn a bit more about me! Throughout this webpage, there is a plethora of information highlighting my
	    skills, expertise, and past work. I have many passions and goals that I am currently working toward and hope 
	    to expand on them throughout my time at Indiana University. The presentation of these points are laid out
	    in a way that is easy to follow but subsequently gets my purpose across. I hope you as a reader enjoy 
	    learning more about myself and gain a deeper understanding of my portfolio.</p>

		<h1> <b>About</b> </h1>
	    <p> My name is Claire Witowski and I'm from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I transferred
	    here to IU this fall as a sophomore and am studying computer science through the
	    Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I recently declared my 
	    cognate as software engineering as I have a true passion for programming and the
	    critical thinking that goes into it.</p>
	    <p> There is nothing that motivates me more than being surrounded by colleagues
	    within the same field of study that strive to be a better version of themselves
	    each and every day. Throughout my short time at Indiana University, I have already
	    met numerous students and instructors that inspire me with their past experiences, 
	    and with that knowledge I have been able to push myself even further.</p>
	    <p> After receiving my undergraduate degree, I hope to stay on the software
	    engineering track focusing specifically on back-end development. I aspire to continue
	    to grow my hard and soft skill sets and never veer away from learning new things.</p>

	    <p> <b>Project Description:</b> This Java code was created in one of my past programming
	    courses. The purpose was to make a fully functioning game with pieces on the board that jump
	    to random places and get rid of one another if they land in the same spot. This process
	    loops endlessly until there is one piece left on the board to be declared the winner. </p>
	    <p> The five classes that went into the creation of this game each did different things like
	    creating the board, randomizing where the piece is placed, and moving said token around. Though
	    this project was extremely challenging to get correct, I came out of it with so much new knowledge
	    on how subclasses can work together to produce something new. </p>

		<p> <b>Project Description:</b> This project was made just a few weeks ago for my CSCI-C211 course.
		Whenever we are instructed to create a function, in this case to land a rocket, we follow an algoritm
		known as the design recipe. This six-step process includes data definitions, signature, function examples, 
		function template, function definition, and testing.</p>
		<p> Though it is a bit tedious to repeat this process over and over, I have learned how to be more methodical
	    with what information is going into my programs and how it intertwines with each other. The projects in this course
	    have challenged me to channel my thoughts in a different way.</p>
